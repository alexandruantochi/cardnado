    <h1>Obfuscate shopping habits and take advantage of discounts</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Some companies are not happy with just selling products, they want to know your shopping habits, name and
      address. If
      you value your privacy and/or don't want to contribute to this kind of data collection, but you want to avail of
      the
      "<i>member only prices</i>", this tool is perfect for you.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Throw your card in the tornado, reach in and pick someone elses'. Could be yours but why care, just hit refresh or
      use it anyway, your prefferences are obsfurcated.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Are you making any money from this?</h3>
    <p>No, I haven't though of any way of monetising this. The cards that you get are the cards added by people themselves. 
      The shuffling algorithm (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a>) is downloaded to your computer/phone and it's easy to verify that it is not biased towards a particular card.</p>

    <h3>Will I still get my rewards?</h3>
    <p>
      This might vary initially as some users could buy more stuff and add more rewards to someones' card but in the
      long
      run it should even out, although one would get less rewards if they consume way more than the average card holder.
    </p>

    <h3 id="brand-faq">Why is this not available for [BRAND NAME]? </h3>
    <p>This tool works best if at least one of the two conditions are met:
    <ul>
      <li>
        the store will offer a discounted price for an item only if a member card is presented
      </li>
      <li>
        the store will offer a reward (e.g. points converted to cash) that can not be accessed by knowing the card
        number (otherwise people could use cards they don't own to cash out)
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
